# Overview

Solace PubSub+ is an advanced event broker that supports publish/subscribe, queueing, request/reply, and streaming patterns. The Ballerina `ballerinax/solace.jms` connector provides programmatic access to Solace PubSub+ through the standard Java Message Service (JMS) 2.0 API, letting you publish and consume messages on queues and topics using JMS session semantics, with support for non-persistent and persistent delivery, durable subscriptions, session-transacted messaging, and event-driven listener services.

## Key features

- Publish messages to Solace queues and topics with `Message Producer`.
- Consume messages from queues and topics with blocking and non-blocking receive via `Message Consumer`.
- Event-driven message processing with a listener and compiler-validated service callbacks for automatic dispatch.
- Non-persistent (at-most-once) and persistent (guaranteed) delivery modes, with optional direct transport for low-latency messaging.
- Standard JMS session acknowledgement modes: automatic, client, duplicates-ok, and session-transacted.
- JMS SQL-92 message selectors for broker-side content filtering.
- Durable and temporary topic subscriptions, and durable queue subscriptions.
- Session-transacted messaging with commit and rollback for reliable message delivery.
- TLS/SSL, basic authentication, Kerberos, and OAuth 2.0 authentication support.

## Actions

Actions are operations you invoke on Solace PubSub+ from your integration. Use these actions to publish messages, consume from queues and topics, and manage session-transacted messaging. The Solace (JMS) connector exposes actions across two clients:

| Client | Actions |
|--------|---------|
| `Message Producer` | Publish messages to queues and topics; commit or roll back a session-transacted producer. |
| `Message Consumer` | Receive messages (blocking or non-blocking); acknowledge, commit, or roll back. |

See the **[Action Reference](actions.md)** for the full list of operations, parameters, and sample code for each client.

## Triggers

Triggers let your integration react to messages arriving on Solace queues or topics in real time. The connector uses a `jms:Listener` that dispatches each message to your `onMessage` callback automatically; no manual receive loop is required.

Supported trigger events:

| Event | Callback | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Message received | `onMessage` | Fired when a message is received on the subscribed queue or topic. |
| Processing error | `onError` | Fired when an error occurs during message receipt or data binding. |

See the **[Trigger Reference](triggers.md)** for listener configuration, service callbacks, and the caller API.
