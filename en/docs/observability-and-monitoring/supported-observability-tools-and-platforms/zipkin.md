# Observe tracing using Zipkin

The sample [shop service](/observability-and-monitoring/supported-observability-tools-and-platforms/overview/#example-observing-a-sample-integration-service) will be used in this guide. Follow the steps given below to observe BI tracing in [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/).

## Step 1 - Set up Zipkin

You can configure BI to support distributed tracing with Zipkin. This section focuses on configuring Zipkin with Docker as a quick installation.

???+ Tip
    There are many possible ways to deploy Zipkin. For more information, see <a href="https://zipkin.io/pages/quickstart" target="_blank">Zipkin Quickstart</a>.

Install Zipkin via Docker and start the Docker container by executing the command below.

```
$ docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

## Step 2 - Import Ballerina Zipkin extension

Create the sample [shop service](/observability-and-monitoring/supported-observability-tools-and-platforms/overview/#example-observing-a-sample-integration-service). To include the Zipkin extension into the executable, the `ballerinax/zipkin` module needs to be imported into your BI project by navigating to **file explorer** and adding the following to `main.bal` file.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/zipkin as _;
```

Zipkin extension has a `Zipkin Span Exporter` which will push tracing data as batches to the Zipkin server endpoint (default - http://localhost:9411) in Zipkin format.

## Step 3 - Enable observability for the project

Observability can be enabled in a BI project by adding the following section to the `Ballerina.toml` file by navigating to the **file explorer** view.

```toml
[build-options]
observabilityIncluded=true
```

## Step 4 - Configure runtime configurations for observability

Tracing can be enabled in your BI project using configurations similar to the following in your `Config.toml` file.

```toml
[ballerina.observe]
tracingEnabled=true
tracingProvider="zipkin"

[ballerinax.zipkin]
agentHostname="localhost"
agentPort=9411
samplerType="const"
samplerParam=1.0
reporterFlushInterval=1000
reporterBufferSize=10000
```

The table below provides the descriptions of each configuration option and possible values that can be assigned.

Configuration key | Description | Default value | Possible values 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
ballerinax.zipkin. agentHostname | Hostname of the Zipkin agent | localhost | IP or hostname of the Zipkin agent. If it is running on the same node as Ballerina, it can be localhost. 
ballerinax.zipkin. agentPort | Port of the Zipkin agent | 4317 | The port on which the Zipkin agent is listening.
ballerinax.zipkin. samplerType | Type of the sampling methods used in the Zipkin tracer. | const | `const`, `probabilistic`, or `ratelimiting`.
ballerinax.zipkin. samplerParam | It is a floating value. Based on the sampler type, the effect of the sampler param varies | 1.0 | For `const` `0` (no sampling) or `1` (sample all spans), for `probabilistic` `0.0` to `1.0`, for `ratelimiting` any positive integer (rate per second).
ballerinax.zipkin. reporterFlushInterval | The Zipkin client will be sending the spans to the agent at this interval. | 2000 | Any positive integer value.
ballerinax.zipkin. reporterBufferSize | Queue size of the Zipkin client. | 2000 | Any positive integer value.

## Step 5 - Run the BI service

When BI observability is enabled, the BI runtime collects tracing data and traces will be published to Zipkin.

Run the the BI service. 

```
Compiling source

Running executable

ballerina: started publishing traces to Zipkin on http://localhost:9411
```

## Step 6 - Send requests
 
Send requests to <http://localhost:8090/shop/products>.

Example cURL commands:

```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/shop/products
```
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/shop/product \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "id": 4, 
    "name": "Laptop Charger", 
    "price": 50.00
}'
```
```
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/shop/order \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "productId": 1, 
    "quantity": 1
}'
```
```
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8090/shop/order/0
```

## Step 7 - View distributed tracing on the Zipkin server

Go to <http://localhost:9411> and load the web UI of Zipkin to make sure it is functioning properly. You can select the service for which you need tracing information find traces.
