# Node Palette

The node palette is the panel on the right of the [Flow Canvas](flow-canvas.md) that lists every node you can add to a flow. From top to bottom, the palette contains a **Search** field, the project's **Connections**, the category sections below, and a **Show More Functions** action at the bottom that opens the full functions picker.

## Connections

A connection is a reusable, pre-configured client to an external system such as an HTTP service, database, message broker, or SaaS API. Connections appear in the **Connections** section at the very top of the node panel, above all other categories. Use them to invoke remote operations from the flow without re-creating the client each time.

### Connection

Selecting a connection in the node panel adds a step bound to that connection.

<ThemedImage
    alt="mysqlClient connection in the Connections section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/connection-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/connection-node.png'),
    }}
/>

To create a new connection, select **+** next to **Connections**. For details on connection types, scopes, and credential management, see the [Connections](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/supportive-artifacts/connections.md) reference.

### Connection actions

Selecting a connection lists every action it supports. Choosing an action drops it into the flow as a step bound to that connection. The action set depends on the connection type. For a database client, the actions are `Query`, `Query Row`, `Execute`, `Batch Execute`, `Call`, and `Close`.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Actions available on the mysqlClient connection: Query, Query Row, Execute, Batch Execute, Call, Close"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/connection-actions.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/connection-actions.png'),
    }}
/>

Each action opens its own configuration form when selected. Action forms typically include a query or payload field, parameter bindings, and a result variable. Use the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md) to author parameter expressions, and the [Type Panel](../../panels/type-panel.md) to bind the result to a typed variable.

## Statement

The **Statement** section of the node panel covers the workhorse operations of an integration flow: declaring and updating variables, calling functions, and transforming records. It sits at the top of the categories list, just below the project's **Connections**.

### Declare Variable

Creates a typed variable in the current flow scope. Use it whenever a downstream node needs a named value that does not come directly from a previous step's result.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Declare Variable button in the Statement section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/declare-variable-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/declare-variable-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Name of the variable. |
| **Type** | Type of the variable. Use a record, enum, primitive, or `json`. Define new types inline with the [Type Panel](../../panels/type-panel.md). |
| **Expression** | Initialize with a value. Author the expression with assistance in the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md). Leave it empty to declare an unbound variable. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Declare Variable form with Name, Type, and Expression fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/declare-variable-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/declare-variable-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Update Variable

Assigns a new value to an existing variable.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Update Variable button in the Statement section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/update-variable-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/update-variable-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Variable** | Name of the variable or field to update. |
| **Expression** | The new value. Use the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md) for type-aware suggestions. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Update Variable form with Variable and Expression fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/update-variable-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/update-variable-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Call Function

Calls a function defined in the project, an imported library, or the Ballerina standard library. Use it to reuse logic across the integration without copying expressions into every node.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Call Function button in the Statement section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/call-function-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/call-function-node.png'),
    }}
/>

The function picker lists functions in three sections: **Within Project**, **Imported Functions** (functions from imported libraries such as `log`), and **Standard Library**. Select **Create Function** under **Within Project** to define a new function inline.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Function picker showing Within Project, Imported Functions, and Standard Library entries"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/call-function-options.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/call-function-options.png'),
    }}
/>

For details on creating, organizing, and reusing functions across artifacts, see the [Functions](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/supportive-artifacts/functions.md) reference.

### Map Data

Adds a data mapper call that transforms data from one record shape to another. Use it whenever the source data and the downstream consumer expect different record types.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Map Data button in the Statement section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/map-data-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/map-data-node.png'),
    }}
/>

The picker lists every data mapper in the project under **Within Project**. Select an existing mapper to invoke it from the flow, or select **Create Data Mapper** to define a new one. New and existing mappers open in the [Data Mapper](../../designers/data-mapper.md), where you draw connections between source and target fields, write inline expressions, or use [**Auto Map**](/develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/supportive-artifacts/data-mapper/ai-mapping).

<ThemedImage
    alt="Data Mappers picker with Create Data Mapper action and existing mappers"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/map-data-view.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/map-data-view.png'),
    }}
/>

For mapping capabilities, array handling, and sub mappings, see the [Data Mapper](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/supportive-artifacts/data-mapper/data-mapper.md) reference.

## Control

The **Control** section of the node panel shapes the path the flow takes. Use it to branch on a condition, dispatch on a pattern, repeat steps, iterate over a collection, or return a value to the caller. Every form in this section accepts Ballerina expressions; author them with assistance from the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md).

### If

Branches the flow on a Boolean condition and runs the matching block. Add **Else If** blocks for additional conditions and an **Else** block for a fallback path when none of the conditions match.

<ThemedImage
    alt="If button in the Control section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/if-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/if-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Condition** | Boolean condition. |

The form provides **Add Else IF Block** and **Add Else Block** to extend the branch.

<ThemedImage
    alt="If form with Condition field and Add Else IF Block and Add Else Block actions"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/if-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/if-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Match

Matches a value against one or more patterns and runs the steps under the first matching pattern. Use `Match` instead of a chain of `If`/`Else If` blocks when dispatching on a finite set of values or shapes.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Match button in the Control section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/match-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/match-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Target** | Match target expression. |
| **Pattern 1** | Binding pattern that the target is matched against. |

The form provides **Add Case Block** to add more patterns and **Add Default Case Block** for a fallback that runs when no pattern matches.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Match form with Target and Pattern fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/match-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/match-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### While

Loops over a block of code as long as a Boolean condition holds. The condition is evaluated before each iteration; the loop ends when it becomes `false`.

<ThemedImage
    alt="While button in the Control section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/while-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/while-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Condition** | Boolean condition. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="While form with Condition field"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/while-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/while-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Foreach

Iterates over a block of code for each item in a collection. Use it for arrays, query results, ranges, and any other iterable value.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Foreach button in the Control section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/for-each-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/for-each-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Collection** | Collection to iterate. |
| **Variable Name** | Name of the loop variable bound to each element. |
| **Variable Type** | Type of the loop variable. Define new types inline with the [Type Panel](../../panels/type-panel.md). |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Foreach form with Collection, Variable Name, and Variable Type fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/for-each-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/for-each-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Return

Ends the current function or service flow and produces a value to the caller. The operation has no required parameters; the optional **Expression** field configures the value to return.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Return button in the Control section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/return-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/return-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Expression** | Return value. Leave it empty for `()` returns. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Return form with Expression field"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/return-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/return-form.png'),
    }}
/>

## AI

The **AI** section of the node panel lets you build AI-powered integrations directly in the flow. It is split into three sub-sections that map to the GenAI building blocks.

| Sub-category | Use it for | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| **Direct LLM** | Send a prompt to an LLM and bind the response to a typed variable. | [Direct LLM calls](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/direct-llm/direct-llm.md) |
| **RAG** | Ground LLM responses in your own documents by retrieving relevant chunks at query time. | [RAG](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/rag/rag.md) |
| **AI Agent** | Run multi-turn workflows where an LLM plans the next step, calls tools, and uses memory. | [AI agents](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/agents/agents.md) |

For an end-to-end orientation to the AI building blocks in WSO2 Integrator, see the [AI Integrations overview](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-integrations.md).

### Model Provider

A model provider is the connection that abstracts a specific LLM behind a consistent API. Add a `Model Provider` once per project and reference it from any node that needs to call an LLM, such as `Augment Query`, `Agent`, or a `generate` action.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Model Provider button under Direct LLM"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/model-provider-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/model-provider-node.png'),
    }}
/>

When you add a Model Provider, the picker lists the supported provider implementations. Select one and configure its credentials.

| Provider | Description |
|---|---|
| **Default Model Provider (WSO2)** | WSO2-managed model provider that supports chat completion. Useful when you don't have your own provider account. |
| **Anthropic Model Provider** | Client for Anthropic Claude models. |
| **Azure OpenAI Model Provider** | Client for Azure-hosted OpenAI models. |
| **Deepseek Model Provider** | Client for Deepseek models. |
| **Google Vertex Model Provider** | Client for models hosted on Google Vertex AI. |
| **Mistral Model Provider** | Client for Mistral AI models. |
| **Ollama Model Provider** | Client for Ollama models running locally or on-premises. |
| **OpenAI Model Provider** | Client for OpenAI models. |
| **OpenRouter Model Provider** | Client for interacting with LLMs via OpenRouter. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Model providers list with Default, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Deepseek, Google Vertex, Mistral, Ollama, OpenAI, and OpenRouter providers"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/model-providers-offered.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/model-providers-offered.png'),
    }}
/>

For provider-specific configuration, model selection, and usage patterns, see [Model providers](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-building-blocks/model-providers.md).

### Knowledge Base

A knowledge base is the central abstraction for RAG. It owns three things: a **Vector Store** where embeddings live, an **Embedding Provider** that turns text into vectors, and a **Chunker** that splits documents before embedding. Build the knowledge base once per project, and any flow in the project can ingest into it or retrieve from it.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Knowledge Base button under RAG"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/knowledge-base-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/knowledge-base-node.png'),
    }}
/>

The picker lists the supported knowledge base implementations.

| Knowledge base | Description |
|---|---|
| **Vector Knowledge Base** | Generic vector knowledge base for managing chunk indexing and retrieval. Plug in any supported [Vector Store](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-building-blocks/vector-stores.md), [Embedding Provider](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-building-blocks/embedding-providers.md), and [Chunker](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-building-blocks/chunkers.md). |
| **Azure AI Search Knowledge Base** | Implementation backed by Azure AI Search. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Knowledge bases list with Vector Knowledge Base and Azure AI Search Knowledge Base"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/knowledge-bases-offered.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/knowledge-bases-offered.png'),
    }}
/>

For the full reference, see [Knowledge bases](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/ai-building-blocks/knowledge-bases.md).

### Data Loader

A data loader reads documents from disk into memory so the knowledge base can ingest them. Place a `Data Loader` at the start of an ingestion flow; the resulting documents are then handed to the knowledge base's `Ingest` action.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Data Loader button under RAG"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/data-loader-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/data-loader-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Data loader | Description |
|---|---|
| **Text Data Loader** | Loads supported file types as `TextDocument` for indexing. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Data loaders list with Text Data Loader"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/data-loaders-offered.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/data-loaders-offered.png'),
    }}
/>

For the ingestion flow, supported formats, and how to point the loader at a directory of documents, see the [RAG ingestion](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/rag/rag-ingestion.md).

### Augment Query

`augmentUserQuery` is the bridge between RAG and the LLM. It takes the chunks already retrieved from a knowledge base and the user's original question, and produces a chat user message that bundles them in a format the LLM understands. Pass the result directly to a `generate` call or to an agent.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Augment Query button under RAG"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/augment-query-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/augment-query-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Context** | Array of matched chunks or documents to include as context. Typically the result of a `retrieve` action against a knowledge base. |
| **Query** | The user's original question. |
| **Result** | Name of the result variable. |
| **Result Type** | Type of the result variable. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Augment Query form with Context, Query, Result, and Result Type fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/augment-query-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/augment-query-form.png'),
    }}
/>

For the full RAG query flow (retrieve, augment, generate), see [RAG query](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/rag/rag-query.md).

### Agent

An agent runs an autonomous workflow against a model and a set of tools. Given a query, it plans the next step, calls tools or other integrations, observes the results, and iterates until the task is complete or the iteration budget is reached.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Agent button under Agent"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/agent-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/agent-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Role** | The agent's primary function. For example, *Customer Support Assistant*, *Sales Advisor*, or *Data Analyst*. |
| **Instructions** | Detailed system instructions that govern the agent's behavior. |
| **Query** | The natural language input provided to the agent. |
| **Advanced Configurations** | Tools, model selection, max iterations, and memory settings. |
| **Result** | Name of the result variable. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Agent form with Role, Instructions, Query, Advanced Configurations, and Result fields"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/agent-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/agent-form.png'),
    }}
/>

For tool binding, memory, and observability, see [AI agents](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/agents/agents.md). For a stand-alone chat agent service, create the **AI Chat Agent** artifact from the **Artifacts** panel instead of adding the node by hand. To reach the same agent over a voice call instead, add this node to a [Voice Agent Service](../../../develop-and-test/integration-artifacts/ai-integrations/voice-agent/voice-agent.md) instead of a chat service.

## Error Handling

The **Error Handling** section of the node palette covers nodes that catch errors in the flow, raise an error value to the caller, or abort the strand entirely. Use the nodes here to add error-handling logic to a flow or to raise errors yourself.

### ErrorHandler

Wraps a section of the flow in a `do { } on fail error err { }` block so that any error raised inside the `do` block is caught and routed to the `on fail` branch. Add the node where you want to start catching errors.

<ThemedImage
    alt="ErrorHandler button in the Error Handling section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/error-handler-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/error-handler-node.png'),
    }}
/>

The configuration form requires no parameters and does not return a result. The form confirms this with a **Configuration Complete** message.

<ThemedImage
    alt="ErrorHandler info panel showing Configuration Complete"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/error-handler-info.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/error-handler-info.png'),
    }}
/>

Add steps inside the `ErrorHandler` branch to log, transform, or compensate when an error is caught. For example, log the error with the nodes in [Logging](#logging), transform it into an HTTP error response, or trigger a compensating action.

### Fail

Raises a Ballerina error value that propagates up the call stack until an enclosing `ErrorHandler` catches it or the error is returned to the caller. Use `Fail` when the integration cannot proceed but you want callers (or an enclosing handler) to recover or report meaningfully.

<ThemedImage

        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/fail-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Expression** | Fail value. Construct an error with `error("message")`, or pass an existing error variable. Use the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md) for type-aware suggestions. |

    }}
/>

### Panic

Aborts the current strand and unwinds the call stack. A panic represents an abnormal, unrecoverable condition that should not be handled as a regular error, such as a division by zero or an out-of-memory failure. Unlike a value raised with `Fail`, a panic bypasses the normal `on fail` error path and is not caught by an enclosing `ErrorHandler`. Reserve `Panic` for conditions where the integration genuinely cannot continue, and use `Fail` for expected, recoverable errors. See the [Panics example](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/panics/) in the Ballerina documentation for the underlying language semantics.

        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/panic-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Expression** | Panic value. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Panic form with Expression field"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/panic-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/panic-form.png'),
    }}
/>

## Concurrency

The **Concurrency** section of the node palette starts parallel work, waits for results, and protects mutable state. Use it when an integration needs to call multiple downstream services at the same time, gather their results, or guard shared state from concurrent updates.

### Fork

Spawns one or more named worker strands that execute in parallel with the main flow. Each worker has its own block of steps and runs independently until joined with **Wait**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Fork button in the Concurrency section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/fork-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/fork-node.png'),
    }}
/>

Each worker is configured with a name and a return type. Select **Add Worker** to add more workers.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Worker** | Name of the worker. |
| **Return Type** | Type of the value the worker returns. Define new types inline with the [Type Panel](../../panels/type-panel.md). |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Fork form with Worker 1 and Worker 2 entries and Add Worker action"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/fork-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/fork-form.png'),
    }}
/>

When the `Fork` is added to the flow, the canvas also receives a default `Wait` node that joins every worker in the fork. The generated code is equivalent to:

```ballerina
map<any|error> waitResult = wait {worker1, worker2};
```

Reconfigure the `Wait` node to join only a subset of workers or to name the joined values, as described below.

Use `Fork` to fan out independent calls. For example, hit two different APIs in parallel and combine their results downstream.

### Wait

Joins one or more worker strands started by **Fork** and collects their return values into a single result. The matching `Wait` node is the join point for the workers spawned by an earlier `Fork`.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Wait button in the Concurrency section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/wait-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/wait-node.png'),
    }}
/>

Each row in the form pairs a **Key** with the worker whose result should be bound to that key. Select **+ Add** to add more key/worker pairs.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Key** | Name of the field in the joined result record. |
| **Variable** | Worker whose result is bound to the key. |
| **Variable Name** | Name of the variable that holds the joined result on the canvas. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Wait form with Key and Variable pairs"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/wait-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/wait-form.png'),
    }}
/>

The configured pairs generate a wait expression of the form:

```ballerina
var var1 = wait {work1: worker1, work2: worker2};
```

Each key in the resulting record holds the return value of its paired worker.

### Lock

Acquires a lock to serialize access to a block of steps that touches shared mutable state. The lock is released when the block exits. Wrap any code path that mutates a shared variable from multiple strands in a **Lock** to prevent race conditions.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Lock button in the Concurrency section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/lock-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/lock-node.png'),
    }}
/>

The configuration form requires no parameters and does not return a result. Add the steps that need protection inside the **Lock** block on the canvas.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Lock info panel showing Configuration Complete"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/lock-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/lock-form.png'),
    }}
/>

For most integration flows, prefer immutable values to avoid the need for locks entirely.

## Logging

The **Logging** section of the node panel emits a message to the integration's log output at a specific severity level. Use it to trace execution, surface errors, and aid debugging in development and production.

The four logging nodes are shortcuts to the corresponding `log:print*` functions in the Ballerina `log` library. Each form takes a single required **Msg** field. Additional options (an attached error, a stack trace, structured key-value pairs) are available under **Advanced Configurations** in the form.

### Log Info

Prints info logs. Use **Log Info** for routine progress updates such as "request received", "step completed", or a summary metric.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Info button in the Logging section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-info-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-info-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Msg** | The message to be logged. Supports Ballerina string templates with embedded expressions; author them in the [Expression Panel](../../panels/expression-panel.md). |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Info form with Msg field and Advanced Configurations"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-info-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-info-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Log Error

Prints error logs. Use **Log Error** for failures that the integration handled or escalated, such as a failed downstream call, a validation failure, or a caught exception.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Error button in the Logging section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-error-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-error-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Msg** | The message to be logged. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Error form"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-error-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-error-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Log Warn

Prints warn logs. Use **Log Warn** for conditions that are unexpected but recoverable, such as a fallback path being taken, a retry being attempted, or deprecated input being encountered.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Warn button in the Logging section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-warn-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-warn-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Msg** | The message to be logged. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Warn form"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-warn-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-warn-form.png'),
    }}
/>

### Log Debug

Prints debug logs. Use **Log Debug** for verbose information you want available in development and typically suppressed in production.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Debug button in the Logging section"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-debug-node.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-debug-node.png'),
    }}
/>

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Msg** | The message to be logged. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Log Debug form"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-debug-form.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/log-debug-form.png'),
    }}
/>

## Show More Functions

The node panel surfaces only the most common nodes and shortcut functions for each section. **Show More Functions** is the action at the very bottom of the node panel that opens the full functions picker, so you can reach any function the project has access to even if it is not listed as a shortcut.

### Open the picker

Scroll to the bottom of the node panel and select **Show More Functions**.

<ThemedImage
    alt="Show More Functions link at the bottom of the node panel"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/show-more-functions.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/show-more-functions.png'),
    }}
/>

### What the picker contains

The picker organizes functions in three sections.

| Section | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Within Project** | Functions defined in the current integration project. Use **Create Function** to define a new one inline. |
| **Imported Functions** | Functions exposed by libraries imported into the project, grouped by library (for example, `log`). |
| **Standard Library** | Functions from the Ballerina standard library. |

<ThemedImage
    alt="Functions picker showing Within Project, Imported Functions, and Standard Library sections"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/show-more-functions-view.png'),
        dark: useBaseUrl('/img/editor/canvases/flow-canvas/show-more-functions-view.png'),
    }}
/>

This is the same picker that opens from the [Call Function](#call-function) node. Use it whenever a node panel shortcut does not expose the function variant you need. For example, every `log:print*` variant beyond the four shortcuts in the **Logging** section is reachable from this picker.
