# Testing

BI has a built-in robust test framework, which allows you to ensure that your applications are reliable. The Ballerina-powered test framework provides support for assertions, data providers, mocking, and code coverage features, which enable programmers to write comprehensive tests.

## Test a simple function

Follow the steps below to get started with testing in your BI project.

1\. Create a BI Project
   Open WSO2 BI and create a new project.
   Add an artifact of type **`automation`** to your project.

2\. Add a Sample Function
   In the generated `main.bal` file, add the following function:

   ```ballerina
   public function intAdd(int a, int b) returns int {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

3\. Create a Unit Test
   Navigate to the **Testing** extension from the left-hand navigation panel.
   Create a new unit test and include an assertion to validate the output of the `intAdd` function.

4\. Run the Tests
   Use the **Run Test** option to execute the newly added test case, or choose to run all the tests under the `DEFAULT_GROUP`.
