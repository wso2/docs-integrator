# Data Mapper Use Cases

The Data Mapper in WSO2 Integrator: BI enables you to visually transform data between formats, such as JSON, XML, and CSV, using an intuitive, low-code interface.  
This section provides a collection of end-to-end transformation examples that demonstrate practical, real-world integrations across various formats.

## What you’ll learn

Each use case in this section helps you understand how to:

- Design input and output types in the Type Editor.
- Use inline or reusable Data Mappers.
- Apply mappings, aggregations, and expressions to manipulate data visually.
- Integrate transformations into automation or other integration flows.

## Available use cases

| Use Case                                                                                | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Read CSV File and Transform to XML File](read-csv-file-and-transform-to-xml-file.md) | Demonstrates how to read a CSV file, map it to a structured `Orders` record, and convert it into XML output using an inline Data Mapper. |
| *Coming soon:* JSON to XML                                                              | Shows how to convert a nested JSON structure into XML with namespaces and attributes using the Data Mapper. |
| *Coming soon:* XML to JSON                                                              | Illustrates how to map XML elements into a simplified JSON representation. |
| *Coming soon:* CSV to JSON                                                              | Walks through mapping tabular data from a CSV file into structured JSON objects. |

## When to use data mapper

Use the Data Mapper when you need to:

- Transform data between different payload formats (CSV, JSON, XML).
- Build file processing or ETL-style integrations.
- Create API payload transformations between client-facing and backend schemas.
- Minimize manual code and maintain readable, visual mappings.
