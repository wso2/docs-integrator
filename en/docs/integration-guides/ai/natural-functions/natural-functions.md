# Natural Functions

In this tutorial, you will create and use a natural function using the WSO2 Integrator: BI. A natural function allows the logic of the function to be described in natural language and is executed at runtime with a call to a Large Language Model (LLM), with the natural language instructions as the prompt.
The tutorial uses a natural function to analyze blog content to suggest a suitable category and rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 based on specified criteria.

???+ tip "Natural Programming"
    To learn more about natural programming and natural functions, see [Natural Language is Code: A hybrid approach with Natural Programming](https://blog.ballerina.io/posts/2025-04-26-introducing-natural-programming/).


## Step 1: Create a new integration project
1. Click on the **BI** icon on the sidebar.
2. Click on the **`Create New Integration`** button.
3. Enter `BlogReviewer` as the project name.
4. Select Project Directory and click on the **`Select Location`** button.
5. Click on the **`Create New Integration`** button to create the integration project.

## Step 2: Define Types
1. Click on the **`Add Artifacts`** button and select **`Type`** in the **`Other Artifacts`** section.
2. Click on **`+ Add Type`** to add a new type and switch to the **`Import`** section. 
3. Enter `Blog` as the **`Name`**, paste the following JSON payload, and then click the **`Import`** button.

    ```json
    {
        "title": "Tips for Growing a Beautiful Garden",
        "content": "Spring is the perfect time to start your garden. Begin by preparing your soil with organic compost and ensure proper drainage. Choose plants suitable for your climate zone, and remember to water them regularly. Don't forget to mulch to retain moisture and prevent weeds."
    }
    ```

4. Add another type with `Review` as the **`Name`** and paste the following JSON payload. Then click the **`Import`** button.

    ```json
    {
        "suggestedCategory": "Gardening",
        "rating": 5
    }
    ```

5. The types are now available in the project. `Blog` and `Review` are the types that represent the blog content and review respectively.

## Step 3: Add a Natural Function
1. Click on the **`Add Artifact`** button and select **`Natural Function`** under the **`Other Artifacts`** category.
2. Use `reviewBlog` as the name of the function. Then click the **`Add Parameter`** button to add a parameter of type `Blog` named `blog`. Use `Review` as the return type and convert it to nilable type using type operators. Then click on the **`Create`** button.

3. Click on the **`Edit`** button to specify the requirement in natural language (i.e., the prompt).
4. Use the following prompt and click on the **`Save`** button. Note how interpolations refer to the `blog` parameter.

    ```plaintext
    You are an expert content reviewer for a blog site that 
        categorizes posts under the following categories: "Gardening", "Sports", "Health", "Technology", "Travel"

        Your tasks are:
        1. Suggest a suitable category for the blog from exactly the specified categories. 
           If there is no match, use null.

        2. Rate the blog post on a scale of 1 to 10 based on the following criteria:
        - **Relevance**: How well the content aligns with the chosen category.
        - **Depth**: The level of detail and insight in the content.
        - **Clarity**: How easy it is to read and understand.
        - **Originality**: Whether the content introduces fresh perspectives or ideas.
        - **Language Quality**: Grammar, spelling, and overall writing quality.

    Here is the blog post content:

        Title: ${blog.title}
        Content: ${blog.content}
    ```

## Step 4: Create an HTTP service
1. In the design view, click on the **`Add Artifact`** button.
2. Select **`HTTP Service`** under the **`Integration as API`** category.
3. Select the **`Create and use the default HTTP listener (port: 9090)`** option from the **`Listeners`** dropdown.
4. Select the **`Design from Scratch`** option as the **`Service Contract`** and use `/blogs` as the **`Service base path`**.
5. Click on the **`Create`** button to create the new service with the specified configurations.

    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integration-guides/ai/natural-functions/service.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integration-guides/ai/natural-functions/service.png" alt="HTTP Service" width="70%"></a>

6. The service will have a default resource named `greeting` with the **`GET`** method. Click on the three dots that appear in front of the `/blogs` service and select **`Edit`** from the menu.
7. Then click the **`Edit`** button in front of `/greeting` resource.
8. Change the resource HTTP method to **`POST`**.
9. Change the resource name to `review`.
10. Click on **`Add Payload`** and specify `blog` as the name and `Blog` as the type.
11. Change the 201 response return type to `Review`.
12. Click on the **`Save`** button to update the resource with the specified configurations.

## Step 5: Implement the resource logic
1. Click on the `review` resource to navigate to the resource implementation designer view.
2. Hover over the arrow after start and click the ➕ button to add a new action to the resource.
3. Select **`Call Natural Function`** from the node panel.
4. Select the `reviewBlog` function from the suggestions.
5. For the **`Blog`** parameter, use `blog` as the argument and click on the **`Save`** button.

6. Add a new node after the `reviewBlog` function call and select **`Return`** from the node panel.
7. Select the `review` variable from the dropdown and click **`Save`**.

    <a href="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integration-guides/ai/natural-functions/add-return.png"><img src="{{base_path}}/assets/img/integration-guides/ai/natural-functions/add-return.png" alt="Add Return" width="70%"></a>

8. The resource implementation is now complete. The function `reviewBlog` is called with the `blog` content as input, and the `review` is returned as the response.

## Step 6: Configure model for natural function
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows and Linux, or `Shift + ⌘ + P` on a Mac, and type `>Ballerina: Configure default model for natural functions (Experimental)` to configure the default model for natural functions.

## Step 7: Run the integration

!!! warning "Response May Vary"
    Since this integration involves an LLM (Large Language Model) call, the response values may not always be identical across different executions.

1. Click on the **`Run`** button in the top-right corner to run the integration.
2. The integration will start and the service will be available at `http://localhost:9090/blogs`.
3. Click on the **`Try it`** button to open the embedded HTTP client.
4. Enter the blog content in the request body and click on the ▶️ button to send the request.

    ```json
    {
        "title": "The Healthy Maven",
        "content": "For those who want a 360-degree approach to self-care, with advice for betterment in the workplace, home, gym, and on the go, look no further. The Healthy Maven offers recipes for every type of meal under the sun (salads, sides, soups, and more), DIY tips (you’ll learn how to make your own yoga mat spray), and quick workouts. If you like where all this is going, there’s a supplementary podcast run by blogger Davida with guest wellness experts."
    }
    ```

5. The blog content is analyzed by the natural function to suggest a category and rate it based on predefined criteria.
